 Most of my work was under NDA, but I’ve gained hands-on experience in both frontend (React + TypeScript) and backend (Node.js/Express or ASP.NET) — building responsive UIs, solid APIs, and even desktop apps with Electron.js. 

 I focus on writing clean, readable code and always look for smarter ways to build. Teamwork, learning, and quality code are my top priorities.`,jobTitle:"Full Stack Developer",name:"Tymofii Soliar",softSkills:["Agile Mindset","GTD Practitioner","Creative","Self-driven Learner","Team player","Adaptive","Persistent","Proactive"]}]}];export{e as default};
